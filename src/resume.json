    "summary": "To me, software development is a way to live out my creativity, as you can realize near limitless ideas with often minimal resources. I always give software its own branding and identity, as it allows others and myself to better relate to it. Whenever something piques my interest, I quickly find ways to get as much new input as possible. A notable example is that I developed a passion for aviation during my travels with CGI and transitioned my career to working in aviation.",
