# Leonard Niehaus Resume CLI Website

This repository contains the source code of my resume in a form of a cli. The project is hosted on my personal website [niehaus.dev](https://niehaus.dev).

## Tech stack

The following technologies/frameworks have been used to build this project

- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for hosting
- GitLab CI/CD for continuous deployment

### Following standards

The CLI dynamically reads all resume information from a JSON file, which follows the [JSON Resume standard](https://jsonresume.org/). The resume JSON file can be found [here](/src/components/Terminal/resume.json).
